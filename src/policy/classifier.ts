 * read-only: `ls` is allowlisted, no listed metacharacter appears, and the
 * remote shell expands the substitution and runs the inner command anyway
 * (GHSA-r8hm-vpm8-cfh6).
 *
 * Listing every dangerous construct is a losing game — `$()`, backticks,
 * `<(...)`, `${x:=...}`, `&&`, a bare newline — so this refuses every character
 * with syntactic meaning to the shell instead, and `$` wholesale rather than
 * just `$(`. The cost is that `echo $HOME` is no longer classified read-only.
 * That is the right trade for the tool whose entire promise is that it cannot
 * write: run-command still accepts it under policy.

 *
 * The four that were not — `dd\s.*\bof=/dev/`, the two `curl|wget …\|\s*(sh…)`
 * forms, and `chown\s+-R\s.*\s/\s*$` — are now segment checks below. An earlier
 * comment here reasoned that ambiguity *within* a match was the only cost, and
 * that was wrong: the engine also restarts at every offset where the cheap
 * literal head matches, so a command built from `dd curl wget chown -R x `
 * repeated ran at 4x per doubling. Measured on the real chain: 64 KB took
 * 255 ms, 1 MB took 65 seconds of blocked event loop, and the stall lands in
 * classifyCommand — before the approval gate and before the allow/deny
 * decision, so no role, approval mode or readOnly flag protects against it.
 *
 * The old note said sanitizeCommand's maxChars cap kept this cheap, "but a
 * policy check should not depend on a limit set three layers away and
 * configurable to any value". Once a config file could say `commandMaxChars = 0`
 * (#123) that limit went away, and the prediction came true. The rewrite below
 * is what that sentence was asking for: the policy check is now safe on its own
 * terms, whatever maxChars says.
 *
 * The existing cost test did not catch it because its seeds are runs of spaces,
 * which never match the literal heads and so never trigger the restart.
